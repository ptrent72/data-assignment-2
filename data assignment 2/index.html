        NYC Service, a division of the Office of the Mayor focused on civic and community engagement, annually surveys city agencies and community-based organizations to respond with the number of unique volunteers they have each given year. In 2019, the NYC Parks Department had the highest number of volunteers out of the 546 organizations surveyed, with a little over 70,000 volunteers counted. 
      </p>

      <p>
        NYC Parks may have the highest number of volunteers due to their presence in all five boroughs, as well as their hundreds of partner organizations that create events and programming in the parks. Upcoming events include leaf-raking, compost collection, and overall beautification efforts. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The volunteer count survey began in 2014 with the goal to highlight the many volunteers with community organizations and recognize them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In late February 2021 NYC Service began their data collection for the 2020 count of volunteers, specifically focusing on volunteers who assisted with the response to COVID-19 and voter registration and census initiatives.

        "We saw equity in action with every New Yorker who volunteered in 2020," said NYC Chief Service Officer Anusha Venkataraman, in a NYC Service press release. "It is our honor to recognize and document the power of trusted community partners, volunteers that showed up to the frontlines of COVID-19 response efforts, and those volunteers that strengthened our democracy for the future."
